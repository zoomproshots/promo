<h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
<p>CalOPPA is the Staet law in the US, which obligates commercial websites and online services to publically disclose data protection guidelines. This law extends beyond California and requires that a website owner in the United States (potentially also worldwide) whose website raises personal data from Californian consumers, needs to publish a visible privacy statement on his website on which it is clearly described which data is collected and who has access to it. To find out more about this, visit: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>

<h3>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h3>
<p>Users can visit our website anonymously.</p>
<p>As soon as these data privacy guidelines are drawn up, we will publish them on our starting page and link you to our first significant page once one enters our website.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Via email</li>

<h3>Fair information practices</h3>
<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles are the foundation of the data protection act in the United States and the principles contained therein play an important role in the worldwide development of data protection laws. An understanding of the Fair Information Practice principles and how they should be applied in practice is important for the adherence of different data protection laws and the protection of personal data.</p>
<b>To follow Fair Information Practices and in case a violation of data protection laws occurs we will do the following:</b>
<p>We will inform the user via email:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Within 1 working day</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides, we agree with the principles of individual remedy, where persons have a right to exercise and enforce their rights in accordance to the law against data collectors and processors who do not abide to the law. This principle does not only require an individual to have enforceable rights against the data user but also that this person has access to the courts and state authorities so as to investigate and/or to criminally prosecute the data processor for not respecting the law.</p>
